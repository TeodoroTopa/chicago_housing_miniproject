# chicago_housing_miniproject

I made this project over a couple days in the fall of 2022 ahead of moving to Chicago for work. I was interested in developing scraping skills, using R, and trying out geocoding, and this project combines each of those skills. First, I scraped apartment listing information for a couple neighborhoods I was interested in (in python, but everything else was done in R). Then, I geocoded each apartment and all the train stations in Chicago. Then, I visualized the distribution of apartments I scraped. Next, I filtered to look at apartments within a certain distance from any train station, by calculating distance to train station for each apartment. Then, I made a few summary tables detailing apartment attribute information grouped by neighborhood and nearest train station, to guide my apartment search. Originally, I was going to scrape information for neighborhoods along multiple train lines, but then I found a place on the blue line (which was where I originally looked), so I stopped there! See below for screenshots of my work in R studio.
